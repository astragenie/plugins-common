# Changelog

All notable changes to `@astragenie/gepa-core` follow semantic versioning.

## Unreleased

**Repo restructure, no functional change.** The `gepa-core` repo was renamed to
`astragenie/plugins-common` and converted to a Bun-workspaces monorepo; this package
moved from repo root to `packages/gepa-core/`. Version, name, exports, and behavior
are unchanged — `@astragenie/gepa-core@^0.6.0` consumers are unaffected. See the
repo root `README.md` for the new monorepo layout.

## 0.6.0 (2026-07-01)

**MINOR** — adds soak-monitor algorithm and promotion-gate algorithm.
Zero breaking changes; existing 0.5.x callers compile without modification.
Consumers pinned to `^0.5.0` resolve this version automatically.

### Added (FEAT-183 S7 — soak monitor + promotion gate)

- `evaluateSoak(state, policy): SoakVerdict` — dual-clock soak monitor.
  Implements the three-decision tree from the FEAT-183 design spec
  (lines 631–652): early-revert on rolling 1-day window regression
  (`soak_pass_rate < main_pass_rate - soakEpsilon`), insufficient-traffic
  revert at `maxSoakDays` cap, promote when both `elapsed_days >= soakDays`
  AND `soak_trials_count >= minSoakTrials`. Pure computation — no I/O;
  caller owns soak.json reads, event logging, and forensics artifacts.
  Resolved C13 (dual-clock prevents premature promotion on low-traffic
  agents) and C20 (soak trial scoring path).
- `SoakVerdict { status, elapsed_days, sample_count, reason, soak_pass_rate,
  pass_rate_delta }` — returned by `evaluateSoak`. Status enum:
  `"running" | "passed" | "failed" | "reverted"`.
- `SoakTrial, SoakState, SoakPolicy` — input types for soak monitor.
  `SoakState.now_iso` is clock-injectable for deterministic tests.
- `SOAK_ROLLING_WINDOW_MS` — exported constant (24h in ms); shared with
  crew-side dispatcher so the window definition is single-source.
- `evaluateGate(candidate, champion, policy): PromotionDecision` — 5-condition
  promotion gate. Conditions: pareto_rank === 1, held_out_pass >= champion +
  minPassDelta, min_held_out_case_score >= minCaseScoreFloor (tail-risk),
  cost_usd_delta <= 0 (unless allowCostRegression), latency_ms_delta <= 0
  (unless allowLatencyRegression). All failing conditions collected (not
  short-circuit) so callers see every blocker at once. Emits structured
  `events` array (`gepa_tail_risk_block`, etc.) for caller to append to
  events.jsonl. Resolved C24 (champion_frozen kill-switch — caller checks
  frozen list before calling evaluateGate).
- `DEFAULT_GATE_POLICY` — policy defaults matching gepa.config.json defaults:
  `minPassDelta: 0.05, minCaseScoreFloor: 0.6, allowCostRegression: false,
  allowLatencyRegression: false`.
- `CandidateMetrics, ChampionMetrics, GatePolicy, PromotionDecision` — types
  for the promotion gate.

### Testing

- `tests/algorithms/soak-monitor.test.ts` — 18 unit tests covering AC-2
  (dual-clock), AC-3 (sample-floor + insufficient-traffic revert at maxSoakDays),
  AC-4 (early-revert 30pp regression), rolling-window stale-trial exclusion,
  and priority ordering (early-revert beats maxSoakDays revert). All 206
  tests pass (gepa-core suite).
- `tests/algorithms/promotion-gate.test.ts` — 10 unit tests covering AC-5
  (happy path + detail snapshot), AC-6 (tail_risk_block), AC-7
  (min_pass_delta_not_met + not_pareto_rank_1 multi-blocker accumulation),
  regression flags, boundary values, and all-fail accumulation.

## 0.5.0 (2026-07-01)

**MINOR** — adds the cross-pipeline cost contract. Zero breaking changes;
existing 0.3.x callers compile against this release without modification.
Consumers pinned to `^0.3.0` resolve this version automatically.

### Added (FEAT-186 S1 — canonical cost shape)

- `JudgeCost` type — canonical cost shape across all judge evaluations.
  Fields: `usd: number`, `latency_ms: number`, `tokens?: { in, out }`,
  `cache?: { hit, tokens_saved? }`. Both `tokens` and `cache` MUST stay
  optional forever (locked by `tests/judge/judge-cost-shape.test.ts`) so
  provider adapters that cannot surface a field (e.g. ollama has no
  prompt cache; `claude-p` subprocess cannot surface tokens) leave the
  field unset rather than fabricate zeros.
- `toJudgeCost(result)` helper — extracts canonical `JudgeCost` from an
  `LLMJudge.evaluate()` result. Forward-compatible: as the LLMJudge
  result shape grows, the helper continues to project just the cost
  subset.

### Changed (FEAT-186 S2 — dailyCapMeter cross-pipeline ingestion)

- `BudgetMeter.record(reservationId, cost)` signature widened to accept
  `number | JudgeCost`. Both call patterns are equivalent at the meter —
  only `cost.usd` is consumed for accumulator math today. Adapters that
  surface richer cost telemetry (`tokens`, `cache`) pass the full
  `JudgeCost` so future observability extensions read them without
  changing this signature. **Backward-compatible:** all 0.3.x callers
  passing a plain `number` continue to work unchanged (covered by
  existing `tests/budget/daily-cap-meter.test.ts`).
- `dailyCapMeter` implementation updated to extract `usd` from either
  shape via a `typeof cost === "number"` branch. Pure type widening; no
  behavior change for `number` callers.

### Why this lands now

Prerequisite for FEAT-183 wave-plan WAVE 1. Without `JudgeCost` +
meter-widening landed in advance of SLICE-98 starting to write trials in
the canonical shape, the dev-team `dailyCapMeter` would read old-shape
evals while the gepa pipeline writes new-shape — exactly the
dual-cost-shape problem FEAT-186 was spun out of FEAT-185 to close.

### Added (SLICE-109 — AzureOpenAIJudge provider)

- `AzureOpenAIJudge` at `@astragenie/gepa-core/providers/azure-openai`.
  Implements `LLMJudge` over Azure OpenAI Service with the standard
  Azure quirks: `api-key` header (not Bearer), URL shape
  `${endpoint}/openai/deployments/${deployment}/chat/completions?api-version=...`.
- Constructor accepts a typed `AzureOpenAIConfig` (endpoint, deployment,
  apiKey required; apiVersion + temperature + timeoutMs optional). **Zero
  `process.env` reads** — env reads stay in the dev-team consumer shim,
  matching the FEAT-185 SLICE-A pattern for the other 4 providers.
- Native `fetch` — no runtime dependencies beyond gepa-core itself.
- `package.json` exports map: adds `./providers/azure-openai` entry point.

Bedrock is intentionally **NOT** included — per operator decision
2026-06-30 (FEAT-183 wave-plan Q3), bedrock is dropped entirely until an
external consumer requests it. The peer-dep CI matrix that previously
anticipated bedrock at 36 cells extends to 30 cells (3 OSes × 2 SDK
states × 5 providers — adding azure-openai).

### Added (SLICE-101 — per-agent judge resolution + rubric loader + PII scrubber)

- `resolveJudge(config, agent, registry, opts?)` — per-agent judge factory.
  Looks up `judge_per_agent[<agent>]` first; falls back to top-level
  `judge` block. Caller supplies a `JudgeRegistry` mapping provider name
  to factory function, so resolveJudge stays tree-shake-friendly (each
  provider lives at its own package entry point). Companion
  `resolveJudgeConfig(config, agent)` exposes the resolved flat config
  for callers that want to inspect without instantiating.
- `redactRationale(text, opts?)` — PII / secret scrubber for judge
  rationale strings before persistence. Catches OpenAI sk- keys,
  Anthropic sk-ant- keys, GitHub PATs (`ghp_`, `github_pat_`), npm
  tokens, Bearer / api-key headers, JWT-shape tokens, and email
  addresses. Companion `containsSecretShape(text)` returns boolean for
  test assertions. Operators can supply `additional` regex patterns.
- `loadRubric(path, opts?)` / `parseRubricMarkdown(text)` — load a
  per-agent rubric Markdown file into a `string[]` of criteria. Supports
  two conventions: `## ` H2 headings (preferred) or top-level `- `
  bullets when no headings present. H3+ ignored as sub-explanations.
  `readFile` opt allows in-memory testing.

### Added (SLICE-100 — rubric scoring + corpus validators)

- `rubricScorer(judge: LLMJudge, opts?)` — Scorer factory that wraps an
  LLMJudge into the `Scorer` interface. Breaks the scorer-circularity
  that blocked optimizing inspector/verifier/architect (per design spec
  concern C1). Propagates `cost_usd` + `latency_ms` from the judge
  evaluation directly into the `ScoreResult`. Retries on malformed
  scores (NaN, out-of-range) per AC-5 — default 1 retry; after retries
  exhausted returns `pass:false / score:0 / rationale:"judge_malformed"`
  with the trial PRESERVED (never dropped).
- `validateTrialCorpus(corpusPath, opts?)` — scans a trial JSONL file
  for integrity issues. Detects torn lines (truncated mid-JSON OR
  schema-fail), duplicate `trial_id` collisions, agents not in a
  `knownAgents` set (or appearing only once when set omitted), and
  trials missing required metric fields. Returns a `ValidationReport`
  with counts + offending IDs.
- `detectEvalDrift(trials, heldOutPassRate, opts?)` and
  `detectEvalDriftFromSplits(train, heldOut, opts?)` — compare train
  vs held-out pass rates and flag drift when |delta| > threshold.
  Default threshold 0.10 (10pp). Default minimum sample size 5 per
  split — drift forced `false` for tiny samples to avoid noise on the
  first few trials.

### Not changed

- `LLMJudge.evaluate()` return shape — unchanged. Still returns the flat
  fields (`cost_usd`, `latency_ms`, `tokens?`) it has shipped since 0.2.0.
  Consumers extract canonical shape via `toJudgeCost(result)`.
- `BudgetMeter.reserve()` / `.release()` / `.spentToday()` / `.dailyCap()`
  — all unchanged. S2 covers cost INGESTION only; full TTL/reserve/release
  flow widening deferred.
- All provider adapters (ollama, generic-openai, groq, gemini) — unchanged.
- `sequentialRunner` — continues to pass `score.cost_usd` (a number) to
  `meter.record()`. Backward-compatible call pattern retained.

## 0.3.1 (2026-06-29)

**PATCH** — wires `OllamaConfig.temperature` through to the Ollama `/api/chat`
request body. Before 0.3.1 the field was declared on the interface but
silently dropped on the way to the API (no instance storage, not in the body).

### Fixed

- `OllamaJudge`: `config.temperature` now lands in `body.options.temperature`
  per the Ollama API spec. Default remains `0.0` so existing deterministic
  callers see no behavior change. Found by `crew:inspector` on SLICE-108
  review (2026-06-29). Regression test added in
  `tests/providers/ollama.test.ts`.

## 0.3.0 (2026-06-29)

**MINOR** — purely additive. Zero breaking changes to the existing `"."` entry
point. Consumers pinned to `^0.2.1` resolve this version automatically.

### Added

Four new discrete entry points under `providers/`:

| Entry point | Class | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `@astragenie/gepa-core/providers/ollama` | `OllamaJudge` | Local/offline judge via Ollama /api/chat |
| `@astragenie/gepa-core/providers/generic-openai` | `GenericOpenAIJudge` | Any /v1/chat/completions-compatible API |
| `@astragenie/gepa-core/providers/groq` | `GroqJudge` | Groq free-tier judge (extends GenericOpenAIJudge) |
| `@astragenie/gepa-core/providers/gemini` | `GeminiJudge` | Google Gemini via native fetch |

All four providers:
- Implement `LLMJudge` from `@astragenie/gepa-core`.
- Accept a typed config object in their constructors.
- **Zero `process.env` access** — env reads belong in the consumer shim layer
  (enforced by `scripts/check-no-env-reads.ts`; runs as `bun run check:no-env`).
- Use native `fetch` — no npm runtime dependencies beyond `@astragenie/gepa-core` itself.

### Naming rationale: `providers/` not `judges/`

The directory is named `providers/` rather than `judges/` because these adapters
serve dual roles: LLM judge evaluation AND candidate dispatch (FEAT-185 Option 1).
The `LLMJudge` interface name is preserved for backward compat.

### AC-9 callout: claude-p stays in dev-team

`claude-p` is intentionally NOT included in this release. It remains in
`dev-team/evals/providers/claude-p.ts` because:

1. It launches `claude -p` as a subprocess — requires `node:child_process`.
2. It has Windows-specific path handling.
3. It carries FEAT-173 tempdir-isolation logic that is tightly coupled to
   the dev-team runner environment.

This is FEAT-185 Option 1 scope boundary. A future FEAT may relocate it.

### Peer-dep table

| Provider | Optional SDK | Install command | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `providers/ollama` | none | — | Pure fetch, no SDK |
| `providers/generic-openai` | none | — | Pure fetch, no SDK |
| `providers/groq` | none | — | Pure fetch (OpenAI-compat) |
| `providers/gemini` | `@google/generative-ai` | `npm install @google/generative-ai` | Optional; provider uses native fetch by default |

The `@google/generative-ai` package is listed in `peerDependenciesMeta` as
optional. The `GeminiJudge` implementation uses native fetch and does **not**
require the SDK at runtime. The peer-dep listing exists so tooling can surface
the install hint and the CI matrix can test SDK presence/absence.

### CI scaffold

`peer-dep-matrix` GitHub Actions job: 3 OSes × 2 SDK states × 4 providers
= 24 matrix cells. Verifies constructibility and `describe()` round-trip per
cell. SLICE-109 (0.5.0) extends this to 30 cells by adding the azure-openai
provider. Bedrock is intentionally excluded — per operator decision 2026-06-30
(FEAT-183 wave-plan Q3), bedrock is dropped until an external consumer requests
it. The previously noted "36 cells when azure + bedrock added" is retracted.

## 0.2.1 (2026-06-29)

**Republish, no content change.** Version `0.2.0` hit npm's 24-hour unpublish lockout
(version slot reserved after early unpublish), blocking a fresh publish under the same
number. `0.2.1` ships the identical source tree as the intended `0.2.0` payload.

Also includes the `.gitattributes` LF pin (commit `7ab6592`) so Windows clones keep
`bun run format:check` green.

## 0.2.0 (2026-06-28)

**MAJOR** (pre-1.0 convention: `0.x → 0.y` is breaking when result fields are added that
user-implemented judges must produce). Audit confirms zero external `LLMJudge` implementers at
time of release (FEAT-184 AC-9); migration cost is nil in practice.

### Breaking changes

- `LLMJudge.evaluate()` result now includes `tokens?: { in: number; out: number }` and
  `raw?: unknown`. Existing mock implementations that return only the previous six fields
  (`pass`, `score`, `rubricScores`, `rationale`, `cost_usd`, `latency_ms`) continue to
  satisfy the interface because both new fields are optional — TypeScript-compatible, but
  documented as MAJOR because callers that _consume_ `evaluate()` results may now rely on
  these fields being present.
- `LLMJudge.evaluate()` opts now include `context?: { fixture?, promptId?, version? }`.
  Adapter implementations MUST forward this field to their observability / Langfuse layer;
  silently dropping it breaks provenance tracking.

### Added

- `tokens?: { in: number; out: number }` on `LLMJudge` result — load-bearing for
  `evals/cli.ts` cost-attribution telemetry in `dev-team`. Maps from
  `providerCost.{tokensIn,tokensOut}` in the old `JudgeProvider` shape.
- `raw?: unknown` on `LLMJudge` result — load-bearing for Langfuse debug emission
  (FEAT-169 SLICE-90).
- `context?: { fixture?, promptId?, version? }` on `LLMJudge.evaluate()` opts — carries
  Langfuse provenance fields through evaluate(); adapters must not drop it.

### Migration guide

**For `LLMJudge` implementers** (zero external today; documented for posterity):

1. Your `evaluate()` method signature is unchanged — both new result fields are optional.
2. To surface token counts: populate `tokens: { in: promptTokens, out: completionTokens }`.
3. To surface the raw provider response: populate `raw: <whatever the SDK returns>`.
4. To forward context: read `opts.context` and pass it to your Langfuse/OTel span.

**For `LLMJudge` callers** (e.g. `rubricScorer`, `evals/lib/run-eval.ts`):

- `tokens` and `raw` are optional; guard with `result.tokens?.in` etc.
- `context` flows in via opts — pass `{ fixture, promptId, version }` from your call site.

**For `JudgeProvider` adapters in `dev-team`** (FEAT-184 dev-team PR):

- `dev-team` `evals/lib/judge.ts` re-exports `LLMJudge` as the canonical type.
- The old `JudgeProvider` interface becomes a `@deprecated` alias for one minor version.
- All 7 adapters gain a `describe()` method (trivial: `describe = () => ({ provider: "groq", model: this.model })`).
- Rubric `string → string[]` migration: wrap-in-single-element `[oneString]` — never sentence-split.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

Initial release. Bootstrap of the GEPA reflective prompt evolution toolkit.

### Added

- Zod schemas: `Trial`, `EvalCase`, `ScoreResult`, `CrewArtifact`, `AgentRun`, `Candidate`, `GepaConfig`.
- Interfaces: `Scorer`, `TrialStore`, `RunnerAdapter`, `CandidateGenerator`, `PromotionPolicy`, `BudgetMeter`, `LLMJudge`, `LockManager`.
- Built-ins: `fileStore`, `sequentialRunner`, `binaryScorer`, `dailyCapMeter`, `fileLockManager`.
- Pure helpers: `paretoRank`, `dominates`, `validateCandidateSize`.
