# Cost Advisor

## Performance Grade: B

Target slice: **FEAT008 SLICE06**
Cost: $139.3701 · duration 13.8 min · cache hit 97.5% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)
- median $: $20.92
- p75 $: $107.35
- median cache hit: 99.2%
- median Opus share: 100.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 100.0% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [LOW] large-tool-output
- 90th-percentile tool result is 6,403 bytes.
- **Suggested action:** Prefer Grep with head_limit, Bash | head -N, or narrower file Read offsets over broad output. Big tool results inflate cache_create.

### [MEDIUM] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 6.2:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [MEDIUM] non-repo-dominant
- Only 15.1% of spend ($20.98 of $139.37) came from the repo-derived session. Bookkeeping is misaligned with where work actually happened.
- **Suggested action:** Either work directly inside the repo's own Claude session, or move the work to its real home. Cross-repo work hides accountability and inflates the next session's context.

### [LOW] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 4 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [HIGH] cost-regression
- Current slice cost $139.3701 is 57% above the last-3 median of $88.6993.
- **Suggested action:** Audit what drove the spike: Opus usage, subagent cold-starts, cache busts, or long exploration loops. Mandate Sonnet-default and a written plan before the next similar slice.

### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 100.0% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
