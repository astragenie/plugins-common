Cost: $137.2836 · duration 15.3 min · cache hit 99.3% · grade avg -

## Baseline (last 9 slices)

- p75 $: $139.37
- median cache hit: 98.6%
- median Opus share: 100.0%

## Per-slice findings
### [HIGH] opus-overuse
- Opus accounts for 100.0% of spend — Opus is ~5x Sonnet on every token category.
- **Suggested action:** Switch routine slices to Sonnet via /model. Reserve Opus for design, ambiguous problem framing, or hard refactors.

### [HIGH] subagent-overuse
- 13 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [LOW] tool-failure-rate
- 5.5% tool failure rate (3/55).
- **Suggested action:** Tool failures are pure waste. Plan the call shape (paths, flags, JSON schemas) before invoking; check pwd / file existence first.

### [HIGH] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 9.3:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [MEDIUM] non-repo-dominant
- Only 7.4% of spend ($10.10 of $137.28) came from the repo-derived session. Bookkeeping is misaligned with where work actually happened.
- **Suggested action:** Either work directly inside the repo's own Claude session, or move the work to its real home. Cross-repo work hides accountability and inflates the next session's context.

### [LOW] many-sources
- Slice spend spread across 4 different Claude sessions. Hard to reason about; cache reuse is fragmented.
- **Suggested action:** Scope sessions per slice. Open one Claude Code session in the target repo and stay there until the slice closes.

## Cross-slice trends
### [MEDIUM] trend-opus
- Median Opus $ share is 100.0% across recent slices.
- **Suggested action:** Default to Sonnet; promote to Opus only on slice-start when the problem is design-shaped.
